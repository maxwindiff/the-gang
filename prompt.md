========

Setup a Django ASGI + React project for a simple web-based poker variant called "The Gang".

Concepts:

- Game room schema:
  - Name (alphanumeric string)
  - List of players (player names are alphanumeric strings)
  - Room state (Waiting, Started, Intermission)
  - Game state (To be implemented later)
- All game room data are stored *IN-MEMORY* in the python server. No need to use Redis or databases.
- Waiting state
  - Players can join or leave the room.
  - Updated player lists are broadcasted to all existing players.
  - Once 3 to 6 players are in the room, any player can start the game (room will enter Starting state).
- Started state
  - Players can play the game. We'll implement the game logic later.
  - Once the game ends, the room will enter Intermission state.
- Intermission state
  - Any player can choose to start a new game, which will reset the game state and bring the room back to the Starting state.

Frontend:

1. Landing page (root)

- Players can choose their screen name and the name of the game room to join.
- Clicking the join button will issue a REST call to the backend.
  - If the room doesn't exist, backend will create a game room and return success to the frontend. Frontend will then navigate to the Waiting page.
  - If the room is in the Waiting state, backend will return success, then frontend will navigate to the Waiting page.
  - If the room is already in the Started or Intermission states, an error will be returned to the frontend.

2. Waiting page

- The frontend creates a websocket connection to the backend.
- Whenever a player joins or leaves the room, the backend broadcasts the updated list of players to all frontends.
- When a frontend window closes (beforeunload), it'll send a Leave message to the backend.
- Any player can start the game when 3 to 6 players are in the waiting area. This will cause the backend to broadcast a Start message to the all frontends. Frontends will then navigate to the Game page.

3. Game page

- We'll implement the game logic later.

========

error: WebSocket connection to 'ws://localhost:8000/ws/game/1/a/' failed: There was a bad response from the server.

I'm able to join the room, but players can't see each other

I joined the game from 3 windows and started the game from player A. However only player A is able to see the game area. Players B and C are still in the waiting room.

i clicked "end game" from player A, but players B and C are still in the game area

the Start New Game button in intermission state doesn't work. also please change the Back to Waiting button to Back to Home (it doesn't make sense to go to Waiting)

when a player leaves the room from the Waiting page, it should navigate back to Home

the "start new game" button in the game over screen doesn't work

========

Now we will implement the game rules. This is a *cooperative* poker game where players need to guess the relative strength of their poker hands. The game is played in 4 rounds.

Round 1 (pre-flop)
- Each player is dealt 2 pocket cards. Only the player themselves can see their pocket cards.
- White chips numbered 1 to N are placed in the public area. (N = number of players)
- Each player can do one of the following at any time:
  - Take a white chip from the public area
  - Take a white chip from another player
  - Return their white chip back to the public area
- Each player can own at most one white chip, so if they took a second white chip, the previous one is returned to the public area.
- Once all players have a white chip, any player can press the Done button to move to the next round.

Round 2 (flop)
- 3 community cards are dealt face up
- Yellow chips 1 to N are placed in the public area. Players will distribute the yellow chips among themselves in the same fashion as the white chips.
- Once all players have a yellow chip, any player can press the Done button to move to the next round.

Round 3 (turn)
- 1 more community card is dealt face up
- Orange chips 1 to N are placed in the public area. Players will distribute the orange chips among themselves in the same fashion as before.
- Once all players have an orange chip, any player can press the Done button to move to the next round.

Round 4 (river)
- 1 more community card is dealt face up
- Red chips 1 to N are placed in the public area. Players will distribute the red chips among themselves in the same fashion as before.
- Once all players have a red chip, any player can press the Done button to move to the scoring phase.

We'll implement the scoring phase later.

========

we should show the previous chips owned by each player to everyone at all times. this way players can look at everyone's "bidding history" to infer each other's hands.

write comprehensive tests for the python backend (joining and leaving rooms, broadcasting updates to players, starting a game, grabbing chips, advancing rounds, going to scoring)

found a bug - at the start of the game, the pocket cards are not shown until someone picks the first chip

I'm still seeing the same problem, pocket cards are not shown at the start of the game

[Log] Rendering check - roomData: â€“ {name: "1", players: ["a", "b", "c"], state: "started", â€¦} (bundle.js, line 31947)
  {name: "1", players: ["a", "b", "c"], state: "started", player_count: 3, can_start: false, â€¦}Objectcan_start: falsename: "1"player_count: 3players: ["a", "b", "c"]Array (3)poker_game: {round:

  [Log] Pocket cards check: â€“ [] (0) (bundle.js, line 31947)

it works now!

========

Now we work on the scoring phase. All scoring happens on the server side, then results are sent to the frontend.

1. First of all, implement the poker scoring rules in a function:

Poker
Royal flush
Straight flush
Four of a kind
Full house
Flush
Straight
Three of a kind
Two pair
One pair
High card

A hand in a higher-ranking category always ranks higher than a hand in a lower-ranking category.
A hand is ranked within its category using the ranks of its cards. Individual cards are ranked, from highest to lowest: A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3 and 2.
Suits do not matter.
If hands are still tied, they are ranked by the highest ranking kicker (cards not used in satisfying the category), the second highest kicker, and so on.
It's possible for two hands to be tied after all tie-breakers are considered. This is called a true tie.

2. For each player, we first compute their strongest 5-card poker hand formed using 2 pocket cards and 5 community cards. We can exhaustively generate all 5-card combinations to find the best hand.
3. Then we rank players based on their strongest poker hand.
4. Then we check if the order of red chips agree with the order of the hands. For example the player with the #1 red chip should have the weakest hand, the player with #2 should have the second weakest hand, and so on. In case of true ties, either order is acceptable.
5. If all red chips are assigned according to the strength of the hands, the players all win, otherwise they all lose.
6. All scoring information (strongest hand of each player, order of hands, win/loss) will be displayed in the front end.

========

remove the "You are: c" and "Round: scoring" UI elements, they should be obvious from the rest of the game state.

actually, remove the round section entirely, not just for scoring phase

in the results screen, render the hand graphically in the "Final Ranking" section, and remove the "All Player Hands" section

remove the "Use the bidding history to infer other players' hand strengths and make strategic decisions" hint

========

the start new game button is still not working, no response at all

actually maybe we don't need the intermission state any more?

remove the "Your Actions" section during normal gameplay. instead: (1) move the "return my chip" button into the "current action" area, next to the player's chip. (2) show the "next round" button in the "available chips (public area)" once all chips are taken. (3) change the "end game" button to a link at the top right corner

hide the "ðŸ“ˆ Bidding History (All Rounds)" caption

layout the community cards and pocket cards side by side (pocket cards on the left), in the order to save some vertical space

slightly reduce vertical spacing between sections to save more vertical space

in the bidding history table, we don't need to show the chips of the current round in both the history column and the "Current Action" column. we only need to populate the history column after a round has ended.

slightly decrease the spacing between the room name and the game area

make the chips in the bidding table more round

now further decrease vertical spacing around the header

more

during scoring, put the scoring screen in the public area

remove the ranking indicators (#1 #2 #3) next to the player names

instead of ordering the hands from weakest to strongest, order them by the numeric value of red chips. put the red chip on the left of the hand and indicate the actual ranking on the right of the hand. the text color of the actual ranking will indicate right/wrong. also remove the red/green border around each hand.

make the red chip more round, no need to include "#". remove the "Team Predictions vs Actual Results" heading

no need to wrap the results inside "Game Results". replace the entire public area instead.

the chips inside the public area should have the same style as the chips in the bidding table

I guess we can make them slightly bigger

the styling of the chips in the public area and bidding table are inconsistent. let's do it this way: light white/yellow/orange/red background, darker gray/yellow/orange/red border, text is always black

actually, let use an even darker shade of the color for the text (instead of black)

========

look for opportunities to refactor and simplify the code, without changing behavior.

look for more opportunities, in both frontend and backend

========

come up with a way to test the application end to end using headless browsers

update .gitignore

========

try to proxy the react backend behind the django server, so that the browser only need to connect to on address. also replace the hardcoded localhost:3000 or localhost:8000 with relative urls.

I see: [Error] Refused to execute http://localhost:8000/static/js/main.a3856546.js as script because "X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff" was given and its Content-Type is not a script MIME type.

update start server script and readme

change python server to listen on all IPs

no need to log API endpoint and WebSocket urls in the script

bring back a dev mode which supports hot reloading using the react/webpack server. so we can choose to start the server in prod or dev mode.

========

change the score table to show all pocket and community cards of each player, but dim the cards not used in the final hand

undefined is not an object (evaluating 'roomData.poker_game.scoring.player_all_cards[player]')

show the pocket cards and community cards side by side, reduce the width of player name

remove the pocket/commmunity heading, slightly increase spacing between pocket and community cards, slightly more narrow player name

========

get playwright to work, ultrathink

fix remaining tests

========

add three sound effects: chip taken, chip stolen, next round

make ChipTaken louder

what are the relative loudness of the 3 sound effects?

increase chiptaken by 30%, chipstolen by 10%

play chiptaken when returning a chip as well

========

when a chip is stolen, display a faint "(N) is stolen by <player>" in the current action area

I'm still seeing No Chip when someone stole a chip from me

are you sure the server is running latest code?

we can simply replace the "No chips" text with "(N) is stolen by X" when a steal has happened. Use the same font style as "No chip"

replace the (N) with the actual chip symbol

make the chip 50% smaller and 20% dimmer

slightly reduce the horizontal spacing between the chip and "stolen by"

excellent, git commit and push, don't forget to include prompt.md in the commit as well

========

in dev mode, add a gray link below the public area to distribute a chip to every player, in order to speed up manual testing

this doesn't work, the window where the link is clicked will try to take all 3 chips. we need to do the distribution on the server side

remember to restart server

in dev mode, generate a random username in the joining page by default, again to speed up testing

this worked. however the distribute chip functionality only managed to distribute 2 out of 3 chips

========

move game rules right after the screenshot. also refactor setup instructions to minimize duplication, specifically venv, pip install and npm install can be factored out.

========

make this work well on mobile, ultrathink

the header needs to be more compact, use no more than ~1cm of screen space

try to fit the bidding history (pre-flop, flop, turn, river) in one row

remove the "Current Action" heading, fit the taken chip and "return"/"take" buttons on one row

can we move the current action to the right of the player name? and left-justify player name and limit its width

ESC

actually you know what, we should put the history next to the player name, remove the Pre/Flop/Turn/River headings. the current action can stay under the player name / history bar

looks good, let's bring back the white/yellow/orange/red boxes which contains the chips used to represent the history, this way people understand what those are. and right align it.

nice, give a very light gray background to the white box as well

make the current action area constant height, reduce the spacing between players

s/Your Pocket Cards/Pocket Cards/

the community cards are taking too much verticals space, maybe we can put pocket cards in one row and community cards on the next row. and slightly reduce the padding inside each card.

for the scoring screen, let's display it this way
+--------------------------------+
| Player |       Hand Type       |
+--------------------------------+
| Pocket Cards | Community Cards |
+--------------------------------+
| Guessed: X    | Actual:  Y     |
+--------------------------------+

hide the action area during scoring (it always shows "no chip" anyway)

remove the "Pocket Cards", "Community Cards" text inside the scoreboard. And no need to layout the cards like a table -- just distribute the 2+5 cards somewhat evenly in a horizontal manner.

bring back the bidding history, players need to see it. we just need to hide the action area.

reduce the margin above "team victory / team defeat"

add a little spacing between pocket and community cards in the scoring area

still has a build issue

but we haven't removed the "no chip" action space -- it should not be displayed during scoring since no action can be taken

on desktop we can still show it (since it doesn't take up much space), but we need to hide it on mobile

the "guessed / actual" text is a bit too to the right

nono, this is margin *below* victory/defeat, the original value is good. I suspect the margin *above* victory/defeat is coming from the padding inside the parent element.

========

delete "you are:" and "room state:" in the waiting page

========

during scoring, replace 'guessed: X' with 4 small history chips, and hide the bidding history

slightly increase the width of the page on mobile

let's do 0.35rem

refactor large views into separate functions, also look for other refactoring opportunities in the ui, don't change any behavior

run all ui tests

re-run and fix all tests

========

the chips in the public area should not move when other chips are taken, leave a faint outline

reduce the height of the take/return buttons, ensure the player rows heights are constant

make the take/return slightly taller, same height as the chips

this is good, but the player rows are a bit too high

remove the "white/yellow/orange/red" text from column headers

in the scoring screen, indicate the key cards used to construct the hand category. For example "Two Pair (10, 7)", "High Card (K)"

in the scoring screen, use red/green borders around the history scoring chips to indicate whether the order was correct during that round

actually I mean use both red/green text and border color

the relative ranking for the pocket cards seems wrong

I got the wrong results from a game hosted on a different server. anyway, the logic for computing the per-round results should be:
1. for round 1, the ranking should be to first sort by pairs, then sort by high cards, using kicker as tiebreaker
2. for round 2, use the 2 pocket cards and 3 community cards to form the hand
3. for round 3, score by the best 5-card pocket hand among the 2 pocket and 4 community cards
